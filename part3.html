        <h3 id="4">3.4 Behind the Scenes: The Collaborative Symphony</h3>
        <h4>Hoyte van Hoytema: Capturing the Cosmos</h4>
        <p>Taking over the reins from Christopher Nolan's frequent collaborator, Wally Pfister, Hoyte van Hoytema faced the daunting task of visualizing the vastness of space and the intimacy of human emotions.
